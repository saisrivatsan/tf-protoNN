# tf-protoNN
The repository contains **ProtoNN** (a KNN based algorithm) implemented in Tensorflow for large-scale multi-label learning. The repository also has a script to run the training on multiple GPUs


## Extreme multi-label (XML) algorithms

Unlike multi-class or binary classification, extreme multi-label (XML) algorithms tag data points with a subset of labels (rather than
just a single label), usually from an extremely large label-set. XML problems usually deal with a large number of labels (10^3 - 10^6labels) and a large number of dimensions and training points.
